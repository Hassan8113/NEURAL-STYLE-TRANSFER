# 🖼️ Neural Style Transfer

## 📌 Internship Project Description

This project applies *Neural Style Transfer, a deep learning technique that combines the **content* of one image with the *style* of another image using a pre-trained neural network (VGG19).

---

## 🎯 Objective

To generate a new image that preserves the structure/content of a given content image while adopting the artistic style of a style image.

---

## 📂 Files Used

- content.jpg – The base image whose structure and objects will be retained.
- style.jpg – The reference image whose colors, patterns, and brush strokes will be applied.
- style_transfer.py – Python script that performs the style transfer.
- stylized_output.jpg – The final output image generated by the program.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

1. *Image Loading & Preprocessing*
   - Loads content.jpg and style.jpg.
   - Resizes them and converts them to tensors.

2. *VGG19 Feature Extraction*
   - Loads a pre-trained VGG19 model.
   - Extracts features from intermediate layers to capture content and style representations.

3. *Loss Calculation*
   - *Content Loss*: Measures how different the output is from the content image in terms of structure.
   - *Style Loss*: Measures how well the output captures the patterns and textures of the style image using Gram Matrices.

4. *Optimization*
   - Starts with the content image as the input.
   - Gradually modifies it to minimize both content and style losses using the LBFGS optimizer.

5. *Output*
   - Saves the final blended image as stylized_output.jpg.

---

## ✅ Output Example

The output file stylized_output.jpg is saved in the same folder and contains:

- *Content* of content.jpg
- *Style* of style.jpg

---

## 💻 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- Pillow
- matplotlib

Use the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision pillow matplotlib
